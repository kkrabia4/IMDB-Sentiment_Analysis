# IMDB-Sentiment_Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to evaluate movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. Using natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model classifies reviews as positive or negative based on their content.
## Key Features:
#### Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed raw text data for better model performance.
#### Modeling: Implemented various models, including LSTM, RNN, CNN, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, to analyze sentiment.
#### Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best-performing model.
#### Topic Modeling: Employed LDA for topic extraction to identify common themes in movie reviews.
## Visualizations:
Created visualizations to display demographic data, review sentiment distribution, and the best and worst-reviewed movies by genre.
