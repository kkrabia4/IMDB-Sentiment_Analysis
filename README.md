# NLP Assignment: IMDB Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains an NLP project focused on sentiment analysis of movie reviews from the IMDB dataset. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project classifies reviews as positive or negative based on their content and provides insights into review trends and themes.

# Features

 **Data Preprocessing :** Comprehensive pipeline for cleaning and processing raw text data, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

** Modeling:** Implementation of various machine learning models, including:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. LSTM
4. RNN
5. CNN

 **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the best-performing model.

**Topic Modeling:** Employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic extraction to identify common themes in reviews.

 **Visualizations:** Created visualizations to display:

1. Sentiment distribution.
2. Demographic insights.
3. Best and worst-reviewed movies by genre.

# Outputs
Processed Text Data: Cleaned, tokenized, and lemmatized text.
Visualizations: Word clouds, sentiment distribution charts, and genre-specific insights.
Model Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each implemented model.

# Troubleshooting
Verify all dependencies are installed if you encounter library-related issues.
Ensure dataset paths are correctly specified in the notebook.
Consult the documentation for additional guidance on dependencies and configurations.
